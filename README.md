-- Two models have been mainly constructed for classification of Tumor and Non-tumor detection.

-- Keras library has been implemented in the present work, where as seaborn library has been used to visualise the features in the available dataset.

-- Finally Confusion matrix has been obtained for the respective models along with the accuracies.
