# Brain_tumor_detection_CNN

The given dataset consists about the information about the images with brain tumour and without brain tumour.

-- Two models have been mainly constructed for classification of Tumor and Non-tumor detection.
-- Seaborn library has been used to visualise the features in the available dataset.
-- Keras library has been implemented in the present work.
-- Confusion matrix has been obtained for the two models along with the accuracies.
